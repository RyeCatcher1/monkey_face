Monkey matcher.

(Python 3.11 is recommended)

A small personal project to match a human face with a monkey image. The code encodes monkey images in a embedding space. The webcame takes input in real time and compares with the monkey-data, showing the most similar monkey mood instantly.

Use ESC to close windows and number 1-10 to reward the model when it matches the monkey mood correctly. The rewards are persistent, so customize carefully.

The model should work for basically any set of images, but human rewards seems to be pretty necessary (it took me around a minute to make the 3 faces match).

I only tested the embedding of the monkeys using my own face, so further customizing may be needed.
